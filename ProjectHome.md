Firefox plug-in which adds a "Manage Folder" item to the context menu of bookmark folders in the Firefox UI. This opens the "Places Organizer" with the specific folder expanded and selected, for easy editing.

Install this extension from the AMO site's [Manage Folders](http://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/7907) page.

To translate Manage Folders into your language, visit the [Babelzilla](http://www.babelzilla.org/index.php?Itemid=264&extension=5148&type=show) page.

This extension was inspired by an earlier version written by Jed Brown, posted to the [Mozillazine forums](http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?f=19&t=322160). It has been rewritten for the extensive changes to both the Firefox Bookmark management, and XUL popup system.
